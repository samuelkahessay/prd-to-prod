      "body": "# PRD: Pipeline Observatory\n\n## Overview\nBuild a Pipeline Observatory — a web app that visualizes, replays, and inspects\nthe agentic pipeline's behavior. Three views: an interactive Simulator showing\nhow the pipeline works, a Replay timeline of the Code Snippet Manager run, and\na Forensics inspector for agent decisions and review outputs.\n\nThis is the second project for the agentic pipeline, and the first using\nNext.js + React.\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Runtime: Node.js 20+\n- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)\n- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)\n- Styling: Tailwind CSS\n- Animation: Framer Motion\n- Data Fetching: @octokit/rest (build-time only)\n- Testing: Vitest + @testing-library/react\n- Hosting: Vercel (vercel.json config included)\n\n## Features\n\n### Feature 1: Project Scaffold\nSet up the Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and\nVitest. Include a root layout with dark theme and a placeholder home page.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] package.json with next, react, react-dom, tailwindcss, framer-motion, @octokit/rest, vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom\n- [ ] tsconfig.json extending next/core-js with strict mode, paths alias \"@/*\" mapping to \"src/*\"\n- [ ] tailwind.config.ts configured for src/ directory with dark mode \"class\"\n- [ ] src/app/layout.tsx with HTML root, dark class on body, Inter font from next/font, metadata title \"Pipeline Observatory\"\n- [ ] src/app/page.tsx with placeholder heading \"Pipeline Observatory\"\n- [ ] src/app/globals.css with Tailwind directives and dark theme CSS variables (bg-gray-950, text-gray-100)\n- [ ] next.config.js with output \"standalone\" for Vercel\n- [ ] vercel.json with framework \"nextjs\"\n- [ ] npm scripts: \"dev\" (next dev), \"build\" (next build), \"start\" (next start), \"test\" (vitest)\n- [ ] Test that verifies the home page renders \"Pipeline Observatory\"\n\n### Feature 2: Static Fixture Data & Data Loading Layer\nBundle real pipeline run data as static JSON fixtures and create a data loading\nlayer that tries the GitHub API at build time with fallback to fixtures.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/data/fixtures/issues.json — array of objects with fields: number, title, state, createdAt, closedAt, labels (array of {name, color}). Include all 17 issues from the Code Snippet Manager run (issues #1-#15, #19, #22, #24). Pipeline issues (#7-#14) must have labels \"pipeline\" and \"feature\" or \"infra\".\n- [ ] src/data/fixtures/pull-requests.json — array of objects with fields: number, title, state, createdAt, mergedAt, additions, deletions, changedFiles, reviews (array of {author, state, body, submittedAt}). Include all 11 PRs (#5, #16-#18, #20-#21, #23, #25-#28).\n- [ ] src/data/fixtures/workflow-runs.json — array of objects with fields: id, name, status, conclusion, createdAt, headBranch, event. Include at least 15 representative runs.\n- [ ] src/data/types.ts — TypeScript interfaces: PipelineIssue, PipelinePR, PipelineReview, WorkflowRun, PipelineData (containing all arrays)\n- [ ] src/data/github.ts — async function fetchFromGitHub(): Promise<PipelineData> that uses @octokit/rest to fetch issues, PRs (with reviews), and workflow runs from samuelkahessay/agentic-pipeline. Uses GITHUB_TOKEN env var if available (public repo, so unauthenticated works too). Returns structured PipelineData.\n- [ ] src/data/index.ts — async function getPipelineData(): Promise<PipelineData> that calls fetchFromGitHub(), catches any error, and falls back to fixture data. Logs which source was used to console.\n- [ ] Unit tests: test that getPipelineData() returns fixture data when GitHub fetch throws, test that fixture JSON files parse correctly and contain expected record counts\n\n### Feature 3: Navigation and Landing Page\nShared navigation bar and a landing page with project overview and links to\nthe three views.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/components/nav-bar.tsx — horizontal navigation bar with: \"Pipeline Observatory\" logo/text on left, links to \"/simulator\", \"/replay\", \"/forensics\" on right. Active link highlighted. Sticky top, dark background (bg-gray-900), height 16 (h-16). Uses next/link.\n- [ ] src/app/layout.tsx updated to include NavBar component above all page content\n- [ ] src/app/page.tsx — landing page with:\n  - Hero section: large title \"Pipeline Observatory\", subtitle \"Visualize, replay, and inspect an autonomous AI development pipeline\", dark gradient background\n  - Three card links in a grid: Simulator (\"Explore how the pipeline works\"), Replay (\"Watch the Code Snippet Manager run\"), Forensics (\"Inspect agent decisions and reviews\"). Each card links to its page.\n  - Brief stats pulled from fixture data at build time: \"8 features shipped\", \"11 PRs merged\", \"~2 hours end-to-end\"\n- [ ] Responsive: cards stack vertically on mobile, 3-column grid on desktop\n- [ ] Test that landing page renders three view cards with correct links\n\n### Feature 4: Simulator — Interactive Node Graph\nAn interactive SVG-based diagram of the 4 pipeline stages. Users click nodes\nto activate them and see how data flows between stages.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/app/simulator/page.tsx — page component that renders the simulator\n- [ ] src/components/simulator/pipeline-graph.tsx — SVG-based node graph with 4 nodes arranged left-to-right: \"PRD Decomposer\", \"Repo Assist\", \"PR Reviewer\", \"Auto-Merge\". Each node is a rounded rectangle (rx=12) with an icon and label.\n- [ ] Curved SVG path connections between nodes: Decomposer→Assist, Assist→Reviewer, Reviewer→Merge. A dashed return path from Merge back to Assist for the re-dispatch loop.\n- [ ] Nodes have three visual states: idle (gray border, dim), active (blue border, glow), completed (green border, check). Track state in React useState.\n- [ ] Clicking a node sets it to \"active\" state, then after 1.5s transitions to \"completed\" and activates the next node in sequence (auto-chain). Clicking \"PRD Decomposer\" starts the full chain.\n- [ ] Framer Motion animate on node state changes: scale pulse on activate (1.0→1.05→1.0), border color transition, opacity for glow effect.\n- [ ] Reset button below the graph that returns all nodes to idle state.\n- [ ] Speed control slider (0.5x, 1x, 2x) that adjusts the 1.5s activation delay.\n- [ ] Responsive: graph scales down on smaller screens using viewBox.\n- [ ] Test that clicking the first node eventually activates all 4 nodes in sequence.\n\n### Feature 5: Simulator — Node Detail Panels\nWhen a node is active or completed, show an expandable panel below the graph\nwith details about what that workflow does.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/components/simulator/node-detail.tsx — animated panel that slides down below the graph when a node is selected (Framer Motion AnimatePresence with height animation)\n- [ ] Content for each of the 4 nodes stored in src/data/simulator-content.ts as an array of objects: { id, name, description (2-3 sentences), triggers (string[]), outputs (string[]), techDetail (1 sentence about engine/model) }\n- [ ] Panel displays: node name as heading, description paragraph, \"Triggers\" list, \"Outputs\" list, tech detail in a muted caption\n- [ ] Panel updates when a different node is clicked. AnimatePresence handles exit/enter transitions.\n- [ ] Close button (X) on the panel to dismiss it\n- [ ] Dark card styling: bg-gray-800, rounded-xl, border border-gray-700\n- [ ] Test that clicking a node shows the correct panel content\n\n### Feature 6: Simulator — Animated Message Particles\nWhen the pipeline chain runs, animated particles travel along the SVG paths\nbetween nodes showing the data being produced.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/components/simulator/message-particle.tsx — a small animated circle (r=6) that travels along an SVG path from one node to another using Framer Motion's motion.circle with animateMotion or manual path interpolation\n- [ ] Particles labeled with the data type: \"Issues\" (Decomposer→Assist), \"PRs\" (Assist→Reviewer), \"Review\" (Reviewer→Merge), \"Dispatch\" (Merge→Assist return path)\n- [ ] Particle appears when source node becomes active, travels to target node over 1 second, disappears on arrival\n- [ ] Particle color matches event type: blue for issues, green for PRs, yellow for reviews, purple for dispatch\n- [ ] Multiple particles can be in flight simultaneously (during fast speed)\n- [ ] Particles respect the speed control slider from Feature 4\n- [ ] Test that activating the first node creates a particle between the first two nodes\n\n### Feature 7: Replay — Timeline Component\nA horizontal scrollable timeline showing all events from the Code Snippet Manager\npipeline run, plotted chronologically.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/app/replay/page.tsx — page component that loads pipeline data at build time via getPipelineData() and renders the timeline\n- [ ] src/components/replay/timeline.tsx — horizontal scrollable container with events plotted on a time axis from 05:29 UTC to 07:24 UTC (the full run duration)\n- [ ] Events derived from pipeline data: \"Issue Created\" (from issues with createdAt), \"PR Opened\" (from PRs with createdAt), \"Review Submitted\" (from PR reviews with submittedAt), \"PR Merged\" (from PRs with mergedAt). Each event has a timestamp, type, and title.\n- [ ] Events rendered as colored dots on the timeline: blue for issues, green for PRs, yellow for reviews, purple for merges. Dot size 12px.\n- [ ] Hover on a dot shows a tooltip with event title and timestamp\n- [ ] Time axis shows tick marks every 15 minutes with HH:MM labels\n- [ ] Currently selected event highlighted with a ring. Click a dot to select it.\n- [ ] Horizontal scroll via mouse wheel or drag. Timeline wider than viewport.\n- [ ] Summary bar above timeline: \"8 issues → 7 PRs → 7 reviews → 7 merges | 1h 55m total\"\n- [ ] Test that the timeline renders the correct number of event dots from fixture data\n\n### Feature 8: Replay — Event Detail Panel & Controls\nClick a timeline event to see full details. Auto-play mode steps through events.\nFilters let users show/hide event types.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/components/replay/event-detail.tsx — panel below timeline that shows details for the selected event. Slides in with Framer Motion.\n  - For issues: title, labels (as colored badges), full body text (first 500 chars)\n  - For PRs: title, additions/deletions stats (green/red), changed file count, linked issue number\n  - For reviews: reviewer name, decision (APPROVE in green / REQUEST_CHANGES in red), review body text\n  - For merges: PR title, merge timestamp, \"Auto-merged via squash\" label\n- [ ] src/components/replay/timeline-controls.tsx — control bar between summary and timeline with:\n  - Play/Pause button (toggles auto-play). Auto-play selects the next event every 2 seconds (adjusted by speed).\n  - Speed selector: 1x, 2x, 4x\n  - Previous/Next buttons to step through events manually\n  - Filter toggles: \"Issues\", \"PRs\", \"Reviews\", \"Merges\" — each toggleable, hides/shows dots on timeline\n- [ ] When filters hide events, auto-play skips hidden events\n- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: Space for play/pause, Left/Right arrow for prev/next\n- [ ] Test that toggling a filter hides the corresponding event dots\n\n### Feature 9: Forensics — Cycle Cards & Review Inspector\nCards showing each repo-assist cycle and a review inspector for AI decisions.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/app/forensics/page.tsx — page that loads pipeline data at build time and renders forensics view with two sections: \"Pipeline Cycles\" and \"AI Reviews\"\n- [ ] src/components/forensics/cycle-card.tsx — a card representing one repo-assist invocation. Data derived by grouping PRs by their creation timestamp proximity (PRs created within 5 minutes of each other = same cycle). Each card shows:\n  - Cycle number and timestamp range\n  - \"Issues Available\" count (open pipeline issues at that point in time, computed from issue createdAt/closedAt)\n  - \"PRs Created\" list with PR numbers and titles\n  - \"Lines Changed\" total (sum of additions + deletions for that cycle's PRs)\n- [ ] Cards displayed in a vertical stack, newest at top, with alternating subtle background (bg-gray-800 / bg-gray-850)\n- [ ] src/components/forensics/review-inspector.tsx — for each merged PR, shows:\n  - PR title and number\n  - Reviewer identity (github-actions[bot])\n  - Decision badge: \"APPROVED\" in green or \"CHANGES REQUESTED\" in red\n  - Full review body text in a scrollable code-style block (font-mono, bg-gray-900)\n  - If review contains \"AI review was unavailable\": show a warning badge \"Fallback Review\"\n- [ ] Review inspector is a scrollable list of all PR reviews, sorted by submittedAt\n- [ ] Test that cycle cards correctly group PRs into cycles\n\n### Feature 10: Forensics — Failure Timeline\nVisual timeline of the 11 fixes applied during the first pipeline run, showing\nwhat broke, root cause, and resolution.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] src/data/failures.ts — array of 11 failure objects, each with: id, timestamp (string), title (short), rootCause (1-2 sentences), resolution (1-2 sentences), category (one of: \"workflow\", \"config\", \"api\", \"race-condition\"). Data (hardcoded from actual run):\n  1. PRD Decomposer first-run failure — wrong trigger config — fixed trigger syntax\n  2. safe_outputs limit exceeded — too many issues created — increased limits\n  3. repo-assist branching from feature branch — stale checkout — forced checkout from main\n  4. PR reviewer temperature parameter — API rejected 0.2 — removed temperature\n  5. MODELS_TOKEN not set — secret missing — added PAT with models:read\n  6. Auto-merge not enabled — repo setting missing — enabled allow_auto_merge\n  7. Squash merge losing Closes #N — commit message setting — set PR_BODY\n  8. Memory branch not seeded — first-run artifact error — bootstrap seeds memory\n  9. Re-dispatch loop missing — no next cycle trigger — added dispatch step\n  10. Ruleset blocking direct push — no admin bypass — updated ruleset\n  11. Race condition in safe_outputs patch — concurrent workflow edits — added retry logic\n- [ ] src/components/forensics/failure-timeline.tsx — vertical timeline of failures. Each entry is a card with:\n  - Colored dot by category: red for workflow, yellow for config, blue for api, purple for race-condition\n  - Title as heading, timestamp in muted text\n  - \"Root Cause\" section with description\n  - \"Resolution\" section with description\n  - Category badge\n- [ ] Timeline section has a heading \"11 Fixes Applied During Run 1\" with a subtitle \"Every failure made the pipeline more robust\"\n- [ ] Vertical connecting line between failure cards (border-left on a wrapper div)\n- [ ] Test that all 11 failure entries render\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n- All data-dependent pages use Next.js static generation (generateStaticParams or getStaticProps equivalent in App Router) — no client-side data fetching from external APIs\n- Dark theme throughout: bg-gray-950 base, gray-100 text, accent colors for interactive elements\n- Responsive: works on mobile viewports (min 375px), optimized for desktop (1280px+)\n- Accessible: all interactive elements keyboard-navigable, semantic HTML (nav, main, section, article), ARIA labels on buttons and interactive SVG elements\n- Framer Motion animations respect prefers-reduced-motion media query\n- All components in src/components/ organized by view: simulator/, replay/, forensics/\n- TypeScript strict mode with no any types\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Live WebSocket updates from GitHub\n- User authentication or login\n- Database or persistent storage beyond static fixtures\n- Editing or triggering pipeline actions from the UI\n- Support for multiple pipeline runs (v1 shows only the Code Snippet Manager run)\n- Server-side API routes (this is a static/SSG site)\n- Deployment automation (Vercel auto-deploys from main, no CI/CD config needed beyond vercel.json)\n",

The Next.js build also fails due to an Octokit type mismatch.\n\n### Workflow hardening\n\n- **close-issues.yml**: `${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}` in a shell *comment* is still evaluated by Actions, injecting the full PR body into the script. Proved by [run 22410403397](https://github.com/samuelkahessay/agentic-pipeline/actions/runs/22410403397): `line 6: -: command not found` (exit 127). Removed the expression from the comment.\n\n- **pipeline-watchdog.yml**: Stalled PRs loop used `for PR_ROW in $(... | jq -c '.[]')` — word-splitting on whitespace fragments JSON when titles contain spaces. Same bug class as the already-fixed orphaned issues loop. Replaced with:\n  ```bash\n  while IFS= read -r PR_ROW; do\n    ...\n  done < <(echo \"$PIPELINE_PRS\" | jq -c '.[]')\n  ```\n\n- **pr-reviewer.yml**: PR title, CI summary, and review decision were interpolated directly into `run:` blocks via `${{ }}`. Moved all user-controlled values to `env:` blocks where Actions handles escaping:\n  ```yaml\n  env:\n    PR_TITLE: ${{ steps.pr.outputs.title }}\n    CI_SUMMARY: ${{ steps.ci.outputs.summary }}\n  run: |\n    echo \"## PR: $PR_TITLE\" >> review_prompt.txt\n  ```\n\n### Build fix\n\n- **src/data/github.ts**: `octokit.pulls.list()` response type doesn't include `additions`/`deletions`/`changed_files`.
