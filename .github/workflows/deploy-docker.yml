#
# Deploy Docker — Builds a Docker image and pushes to GitHub Container Registry.
# Called by deploy-router.yml when the active profile is docker-generic.
#
# The image is pushed to ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:latest and :sha.
# Downstream deployment (Railway, Fly, Azure Container Apps, etc.) can pull
# from GHCR using a webhook or polling strategy.
